<br>
A Log Lady tends each stump in memory’s grove.<br>
Her narrow hands, stained cedar red, cast lots by phone.<br>
With burnt wood beside her, she awaits the Fates' calls.<br>
Young Cassandra floats in, and old Sibyl reads palms.<br>
Paradise grows from gossip’s seed and prophecy.<br>
The seeress seeks out coffee, pie, and company.
