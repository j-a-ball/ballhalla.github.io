For each stump in memory's grove, a Log Lady:<br><br>
Her narrow hands, cedar sap-stained, now hold a phone.<br><br>
Burnt are her eyes, the log she keeps, and all she sees.<br><br>
Young Cassandra floats â€“ but not so, sibylline hopes.<br><br>
Paradise grows from gossip seeds and prophecies.<br><br>
While the seeress wants pie, coffee, and company.
