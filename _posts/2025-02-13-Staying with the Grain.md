For each stump in memory's grove, a Log Lady â€“<br>
her narrow Hands, cedar sap-stained, now hold a phone.<br>
Burnt are her eyes, the log she keeps, and all she sees.<br>
Young Cassandra floats. But not so, her heavy hopes.<br>
Paradise grows from gossip seeds and prophecies.<br>
The seeress just wants pie, coffee, and company.
