Gather your wits, compatriots.
"Riviera," the hypocrite!
America, O surrogate
whose shame permits, and Justice quits.<br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.
From the river, a counterfeit,
cruel lawgiver, charges remits.
The pact commits; follow its writs.<br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.
Progress has stalled, walled bit by bit.
Grossly enthralled, we recommit.
Ignore the twits. Our conscience splits.<br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.
To pick quarrels, what good does it?
What of morals? Care not a whit?
Heaven admits that it omits.<br>
Gather your wits, compatriots,
for Gaza's fate our fate befits.
