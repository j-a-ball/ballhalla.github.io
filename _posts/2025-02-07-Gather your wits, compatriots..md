Gather your wits, compatriots.<br>
"Riviera," the hypocrite!<br>
America, O surrogate<br>
whose shame permits, and Justice quits.<br><br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.<br>
From the river, a counterfeit,<br>
cruel lawgiver, charges remits.<br>
The pact commits; follow its writs.<br><br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.<br>
Progress has stalled, walled bit by bit.<br>
Grossly enthralled, we recommit.<br>
Ignore the twits. Our conscience splits.<br><br>
Gather your wits, compatriots.<br>
To pick quarrels, what good does it?<br>
What of morals? Care not a whit?<br>
Heaven admits that it omits.<br><br>
Gather your wits, compatriots,<br>
for Gaza's fate our fate befits.<br>
