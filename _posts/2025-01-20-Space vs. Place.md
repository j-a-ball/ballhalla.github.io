I first came across the philosophical space/place distinction in a reference to [Michel de Certeau's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Certeau) axiom, [translated from the French](https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf): "Space is practiced place." «L’espace est le lieu pratiqué.» (1984) Even while trying to locate the exact French phrase, I saw many examples of «le lieu» swapped for «l'espace». But I so often hear trite phrases like "safe space" and "sacred space," and I know that cartesian space is a post-enlightenment invention. As another example, we have Saxon "instead of" and Norman "in lieu of," both meaning in place of. So, while I think that de Certeau clearly had it right for European languages, it is odd to note how Eastern scholars like [Arjun Appadurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai) and [Yi-Fu Tuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi-Fu_Tuan)  have flipped the space/place distinction, thereby making more of place than space.

It could be arbitrary. Or, it could be cosmological. In the Germanic languages, we have obvious toponyms like Norwich, Hallstatt, Uppsala, Trondheim, etc. But the literal signification is nil. By contrast, when I lived in Jordan, I was once told offhandedly by an American expat to pay attention to landmarks, because the locals supposedly navigate by them in a way that we road-and-route trekkers do not. I found this to be true (although, maybe we were just both lost and trying to understand a foreign place).

Appadurai’s (1995) concept of the “production of locality” is about “transforming spaces into places” ([1996, 183](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816627936/modernity-at-large/)). He explicitly credited de Certeau for making the distinction. I suppose a postcolonial geography inverts things.

Yi-Fu Tuan, an influential "human geographer" (funny title imo), wrote an earlier [1977 book](https://archive.org/details/spaceplaceperspe0000tuan/page/n7/mode/2up) arguing that [place is space made meaningful](https://ls.wisc.edu/news/belonging-to-this-place-a-conversation-with-yi-fu-tuan/). While both Tuan and de Certeau's books were published by UMinn Press, and while the latter doesn't reference the former, because of the distinct English vs. French milieus I don't think we have a case of appropriation. Instead, what I see is Tuan the geographer taking space for granted, and de Certeau the Derridean deconstructionist doing the opposite.

The Greek and Latin etymologies aren't too helpful. Plateia (_πλατεία_) -> piazza, plaza, platz, etc. *Spatium* -> epacio, l'espace, and space. Space has been uniquely used to refer to spans of time. But in Arabic, I really don't think the distinction is salient – مكان (makaan) comes from the root for being and entities, while كون refers to the universe, all of creation. I am left thinking that we Westerners have a peculiar idea of locality.
