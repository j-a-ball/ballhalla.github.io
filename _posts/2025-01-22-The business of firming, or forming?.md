title: The business of firming, or forming?

description: Some intellectuals are about affirming and confirming, others informing and conforming. I favor the latter, which is a project of using language to create a shared (conformal) experience.

Consider academics who affirm their identities, and who also confirm their biases. Next, consider academics who inform others in order to conform with them. While both firming and forming are intellectuals' business, I've come down on the side of forming. A good poet innovates in form to help us conform to higher ideals. In other words, my ideal of language use privileges creative acts of (con)formation over replicative acts of confirmation.

This identifies me with a kind of poetics shared by Whitehead and Rorty. On one hand, I'm exasperated by fleeting arguments about metaphysics (Rorty), but on the other, metaphysical talk about enduring creations (Whitehead), such as rights, is self-evidently useful. Rorty's critique[^1] is still apt: The assertion that "there are rights," could be redescribed as "under certain conditions we are disposed to say 'there are rights,' and that means..." What remains of Whitehead's thinking after Rorty's critique is an idea that it is in the business of times to change. So, we should make ourselves busy by changing things.

David L. Hall helpfully clarified that Rorty and Whitehead started out with different problematics.[^2] Rorty wanted to solve an epistemological problem that results from having access to multiple competing vocabularies. Hall wrote that "Whitehead's problematic was how to characterize an intuition that, for a variety of reasons, had been marginalized in traditional philosophical discussion – namely, the intuition of flux and change."[^3]
<ul>
That "all things flow" is the first vague generalization which the unsystematized, barely analyzed, intuition of men has produced... If we are able to go back to that ultimate, integral experience, unwarped by the sophistications of theory, that experience whose elucidation is the sole aim of philosophy, the flux of things is the one ultimate generalization around which we must weave our philosophic theory.<br><br>Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality – an Essay in Cosomology (The Free Press: 1978), 208.
</ul>
The poet (*dichter*) and the philosopher (*denker*) do similar things. Rorty, for his "laissez-faire nominalism – his attempt to leave everything (except language) as it is – [was] forced to remain at the 'meta' level."[^4] He made everything of the poet's functional ability to change vocabularies and exchange metaphors. Whitehead was not far off:
<ul>
Philosophy is either self-evident or it is not philosophy... The aim of philosophy is sheer disclosure... (49)<br>
... to find a conventional phraseology for the vivid suggestiveness of the poet... and thereby to produce a verbal symbolism manageable in other connections of thought (50).<br><br>
Philosophy is akin to poetry... In each case there is reference to form beyond the direct meanings of words. Poetry allies itself to metre, philosophy to mathematical pattern. (174)<br><br>
A. N. Whitehead, Modes of Thought (Macmillan 1938).
</ul>
The difference between poetry and philosophy is a matter of understanding, according to Hall's interpretation of Whitehead. Poetry aids aesthetic understanding of the unrepeatable rhythm at a given time or place, while philosophy aids logical understanding of repeating, relational patterns.
