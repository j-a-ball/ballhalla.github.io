Outside West College, the first hall built at my alma mater (then located in West Township, MA), stands Hopkins Memorial Gate. It's taboo to go through before graduating, but I often did anyway because it was a pain to go around without walking over icy grass or perpendicular sidewalks. That's why I hardly remember passing through it during Commencement, in line with tradition. Oops. The gate features an aphoristic poem that now serves as college motto:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
<div class="col-sm-6">

Climb High<br>
Climb Far<br>
Your Goal<br>
The Sky<br>
Your Aim<br>
The Star.

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">

Its enthusiasm for youth complements the old motto, *E liberalitate E. Williams, armigeri*.

Seven to ten years later, while studying near Palo Alto, CA at "the Cornell of the West," I took a weekend trip down to Carmel-by-the-Sea. Bringing along a girlfriend from NYC, I really wanted to see [Eyvind Earle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyvind_Earle) paintings at [gallery21](https://gallery21.com/). Eyvind (pronounced eye-vind) Earle led a full career but is best known for illustrating the expressionistic backgrounds in Disney's *Sleeping Beauty* (1959). Earle was the central coast's best appreciator (apart from Robinson Jeffers[^1]), and a fellow NY transplant who repeatedly painted views of the Santa Lucia range rolling down to meet the Pacific. The gallery owner – friendly, smart, and kooky, i.e., my type of person – told me that Earle worked like a mystic, hanging all his WIPs around the studio and working on them simultaneously, one touch at a time. ADHD, I first thought, but cohesiveness I now recognize. A poem was displayed in the gallery's front window:
<ul>

Starting from nothing <br>
to where we are,<br>
is farther than the farthest star.<br><br>
And farther than the farthest star,<br>
is where we are going from where we are.<br><br>
– Eyvind Earle, 1979

</ul>
Youthful hubris gives way to aged wisdom, and the world keeps turning. Earle's poem was beside this painting:
