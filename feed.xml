I work out to these and work out my emotions through them. They’re distinct from a first wave of thrash-inspired bands – exemplified by Bathory, whose <em>Under the Sign of the Black Mark</em> (1987) cleaved away something altogether new, and whose <em>Blood Fire Death</em> (1988) rooted various subgenres in norse myth. This has since led to post-pagan meditations on time and place, and an ambient, naturalistic habit (at least in my preferred vein). Mayhem carried the torch back to Norway, where it set fire to churches, making a controversy of things. That was a thesis statement, while the antithesis is still being articulated. The synthesis lies on the horizon. My own selfish narrative began in 1994, when both I and this decidedly avant-garde tradition of black metal were given form: <br/></p> <ol> <li>Emperor, <em>In the Nightside Eclipse</em> (1994) – With respect to Bathory, this album bore the seeds that grew into the contemporary scene. One can hear in it the footfalls of the <em>jötnar</em>, wandering and sometimes sprinting across the frozen wastes.<br/>[Favorite track: “I Am the Black Wizards;” also Bathory cover “A Fine Day to Die”]<br/></li> <li>Ulver, <em>Bergtatt - Et eeventyr i 5 capitler</em> (1995) – The earliest <em>gesamtkunstwerk</em> in the genre. This album offers a refined atmospheric sensibility, with powerful blasts, ethereal singing, acoustic interludes, and even a flute’s zephyr. Here’s to 30+ years of Ulver’s lycanthropy, and as many more moons as nature will allow.<br/>[Favorite track: “I Troldskog Faren Vild”]<br/></li> <li>In The Woods…, <em>Heart of the Ages</em> (1995) – This album, I.t.W.’s first full-length, is eccentric and wonderful. Its varied instrumentation; wild, timeless motifs; female vocals; singing in English; and production quality put the band leagues ahead of the following wave. I think they play this on repeat in Twin Peaks’ Black Lodge. It’s not as strong as <em>Bergtatt</em> but harmonizes with that album in its softer moments, making it a masterwork in its own right.<br/>[Favorite track: “The Divinity of Wisdom”]<br/></li> <li>Paysage d’Hiver, <em>Paysage d’Hiver</em> (1999) – This demo by Swiss auteur Wintherr distorts recording technology, even as it transports listeners somewhere between Valhalla and Naströnd, or Fólkvangr and Helheim. Wintherr made everything we hear in it: a violin’s melody deadened by snow, synth dissipating into space, and the gathering storm of guitars and drums. Think William Basinski’s <em>The Disintegration Loops</em> (2002-3), but if rather than an evanescent time-capture of 9/11’s aftermath, it were a palimpsest of European war.<br/>[Favorite track: “Welt aus Eis”]<br/></li> <li>Agalloch, <em>The Mantle</em> (2002) – This masterpiece by Oregon’s greatest band is on my view the second wave’s culminating work of art. It was post-black metal before we knew it. Agalloch, named for عود (<em>oud</em>), that fragrant wood of the gods, imbued this album with the umbralight quality of pagan forestry. Words to describe it in English are lacking: <em>chiaroscuro</em>, <em>komorebi</em> (木漏れ日), <em>lichtung</em>.<br/>[Favorite track: “…And The Great Cold Death Of The Earth”]<br/></li> <li>Drudkh, <em>Autumn Aurora</em> (2004) – Uniting Ukrainian (eco)poetics with a wonderfully articulated animism, this album is a kind of totem for me. I first listened to it while driving down through Colorado, with stark views of a lonely mountain; I hope to listen to it again someday, when I visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)">Pando</a> in its Autumnal splendor.<br/>[Favorite track: “Sunwheel – Сонячне Коло”]<br/></li> <li>Wolves In the Throne Room, <em>Diadem of 12 Stars</em> (2006) – This debut album holds a Cascadian candle to Europa’s torch, and this band has been, for me at least, the American scene’s leading lights ever since. The drumming somehow bridges aggressive shredding with thunderous dirges, while Jamie Myers’s guest vocals nurtured this fragile offshoot of Olympia, WA’s iconoclastic scene.<br/>[Favorite track: “Queen of Borrowed Light”]<br/></li> <li>Lunar Aurora, <em>Andacht</em> (2008) – Finally, a <em>gesamtkunstwerk</em> by German artists. This album uplifts the spirit, enveloping all of one’s senses, although it’s also quite grotesque. True beauty after the manner of Murnau’s (and Herzog’s, and lately, Eggers’s) <em>Nosferatu</em>.<br/>[Favorite track: “Findling”]<br/></li> <li>Blut Aus Nord, <em>Memoria Vetusta II – Dialogue With The Stars</em> (2009) – In spite of metal that invokes the cosmos through anthropomorphized angels and other made up entities, this album is a hopeless, starry epic. Track “The Formless Sphere – Beyond the Reason” ceases all vocals in a triumphant end to man. The art of giving meaning to the void, however, is human to no end.<br/>[Favorite track: “Findling”]<br/></li> <li>Aquius, <em>Griseus</em> (2011) – Simply suburb symphonic black metal. I can listen to this album back to back with Enya, which is how things should be: harmonious, interdependent, in a state of syzygy. We must make it so.<br/>[Favorite track: “Sanguinem”]<br/><br/><br/> 15 honorable mentions, for the sake of synergy:<br/> <ul> <li>Master’s Hammer, <em>Ritual</em> (1991) – The vocals are awful, the pace meandering (as if over the Bohemian Massif), and still this album made a series of footnotes out of much of the second wave.</li> <li>Mayhem, <em>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</em> (1994) – Vile. Mayhem’s best work is dissonance incarnate with lore to match. The title track/closer’s use of liturgical choruses rendered the “satanic” side of the genre into a dialectic, finally.</li> <li>Marduk, <em>Opus Nocturne</em> (1994) – Delivered from the grand pulpit of hell, while bands like Ghost were still wraithlings. The most chthonic entry on the list.</li> <li>Satyricon, <em>Nemesis Divina</em> (1996) – Satyricon composed the Magnum Opus of second wave black metal <em>qua</em> music. It’s not overly sophisticated, and for good reason.</li> <li>Blut Aus Nord, <em>Memoria Vetusta I – Fathers Of The Icy Ages</em> (1996) – This, taken together with the iconic French black metallers’ debut, <em>Ultima Thulée</em> (1995), make for the finest Norman smorgasbord. Everything Emperor and Marduk offered, refined to a différant taste.</li> <li>Nagelfar, <em>Hünengrab im Herbst</em> (1997) – Higher in production value than any prior album in the experimental vein, save <em>Nemesis Divina</em>, and in my opinion, the perfect precursor to the continental tradition.</li> <li>Sad Legend, <em>Sad Legend</em> (1998) – Hearing Naamah (나마)’s vocals on heartfelt opener “Han” makes me wonder how other metal artists could develop their own choral fidelity.</li> <li>Windir, <em>1184</em> (2001) – This album was flawlessly executed. In many respects, I find it to be a harsher take on <em>Heart of the Ages</em>. RIP Valfar, whose young life the cold indifferently took.</li> <li>Sigh, <em>Imaginary Soundscape</em> (2001) – It’s scary how clever this collection of songs is, by a troupe of Japanese black metal großmeister. <em>Imaginary Soundscape</em> projects familiarity with more genres than I care to name, mostly Western, which is why it’s offensive that the best aesthetic description I can mount in response is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8MdhLepdUE">Jigoku</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJgXU98lp8I">Kabuki</a> à la Nobu Nakagawa, in Gothic facepaint.</li> <li>Negurǎ Bunget, <em>OM</em> (2006) – Intricate, progressive if not revolutionary, and rooted in the tradition despite its unusual sensibilities. Not a single other album I’ve listed is out of touch with <em>OM</em>, although Negurǎ Bunget dug deeper into other things.</li> <li>Drautran, <em>Throne of the Depths</em> (2007) – Drautran’s debut and one-and-only. The instrumental compositions on this album are a cut above, and the vocals are exceptionally far-ranging. Few others achieve this level of atmosphere.</li> <li>Elderwind, <em>Волшебство живой природы / The Magic of Nature</em> (2012) – Purely atmospheric, a bit murky, and a favorite album for me to play in the Adirondacks.</li> <li>Batushka, <em>Литоургиiа (Litourgiya)</em> (2015) – The original eastern orthodox album resulted from creator Derph’s epiphany. Usurper Bart’s band Patriarkh deserves profanity. In Derph’s words: “God’s hymns are more metal than any satanic black metal music out there.” Amen to that.</li> <li>Mephorash, <em>Shem Ha Mephorash</em> (2019) – The most mature performance artists on the list. I didn’t understand what it meant for an album to be demanding until suffering (gladly) though <em>Shem Ha Mephorash</em>, a mystical experience of recurring motifs torn asunder.</li> <li>Havukruunu, <em>Uinuos Syömein Sota</em> (2020) – The spirit of Scandinavian black metal went eastward, where Havukruunu’s crowning achievement was made (although each of their albums has been on the level). <em>Uinuos Syömein Sota</em> rings like a clear callback across the Gulf of Bothnia.<br/> Next to listen to: Abigor, Absu, Akitsa, Ascension, and that’s just A’s. Conspicuously absent: Burzum, Deathspell Omega, Immortal, Taake <br/> If you read to this point: Listen to more of this kind of music. If you’re a <em>fǫru-nautr</em> who is now wondering “Why the bias against the extreme wing?” – I have two ideas for you on our journey. First, beware unwittingly emulating that which you oppose. Second, negative aesthetics are nothing without beauty, and this has immediate consequences.<br/> Stay tuned for more.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="lists"/><category term="music"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resonant ripples of the second wave.

I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything; but of course there’s nothing like that here.”<br/> “<em>Porridge à la Russe</em>, your honor would like?” said the Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.<br/> “No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I’ve been skating, and I’m hungry. And don’t imagine,” he added, detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky’s face, “that I shan’t appreciate your choice. I am fond of good things.”<br/> “I should hope so! After all, it’s one of the pleasures of life,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Well, then, my friend, you give us two—or better say three—dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables...”<br/><br/> <span href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1399/pg1399-images.html">– Leo Tolstoy, <em>Anna Karenina</em> (translation by Constance Garnett)</span> </ul> <p><br/> What is more universal than <em>soup</em>? One of my fondest memories: After a chilly UB football game, my dad took me to Scharf’s, a since-closed Schiller Park restaurant whose liver dumpling soup I would give anything to have again. Like wings, beef on weck, and sponge candy, lebernödelsuppe is a taste of home.</p> <p>Later, as an undergraduate, I attended a <a href="https://claiming.williams.edu/2015/03/13/special-event-stone-soup-what-is-the-taste-of-williams/">soup potluck</a> during cold Williamstown February. We shared a mess of pottage and read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">pan-European folk tale about soup being made from a stone</a>. Now, I’m not fond of metaphors for making up a <em>fondant</em> culture. But I still have a soft spot for potluck <em>potage</em>.</p> <p>Cooking for myself, I prefer to make healthy meals with easily reheated leftovers. Soups are <a href="https://bushwickdaily.com/bushwick/perpetua-stew-bushwick-wikipedia-annie-rauwerda/">eternal</a> – the bones and peels and cores from one meal become a stock for the next. I currently cook two soups a week. Beside Pablo Neruda’s lovely poem about eel stew, I’ve listed below 10 soups I recently enjoyed: <br/></p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"> <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;"> 1. <strong>Gulyásleves</strong> – paprika soup with bell pepper, beef, root vegetables, and egg noodles. I crave this heartily. <em>Mindennapi levesünk</em>, "our daily soup," is the Hungarian equivalent of "daily bread."<br/><br/> 2. <strong>Zuppa Toscana</strong> – sausage, potato, and kale soup. I make it frequently and like mine with sweet red pepper added.<br/><br/> 3. <strong>Pasta e Fagioli</strong> – ditalini and bean soup. I made red (tomato base), although <span href="https://www.angolalakesidemarket.com/">I grew up on white (vegetable broth/guanciale/parmesan base), with sausage added.</span> <br/><br/> 4. <strong>Minestrone</strong> – Italian soup with vegetables galore, and also some ditalini. It's often red, but I opted to make it <em>alla genovese</em>, with pesto.<br/><br/> 5. <strong>Jägertopf</strong> – hunter's stew, improvised with the meats available to me. I love turnips in this, while juniper berries and lingonberry preserves accentuate their sweetness. Tyrolese / Alpine wine is hard to find, so I cooked it down using Californian pinot noir. <br/><br/> 6. <strong>Kulajda</strong> – Czech mushroom soup, heavy on the dill. This is the first dish I've found that makes good use of dried (porcini) mushrooms.<br/><br/> 7. <strong>Borscht</strong> – beets, dill, and sour cream. I prefer beef borscht with broth made from scratch. Grating the beets always leaves my fingers ruddy. Once I even had a puréed beet-cream smoothie, served chilled at Barney Greengrass on the UWS. Sweet and perfect for summer.<br/><br/> 8. <strong>Solyanka</strong> – Russian anything-goes soup with pickles and olives/capers. I used kielbasa, but mushroom and cured fish versions entice me.<br/><br/> 9. <strong>Lohikeitto</strong> – Finnish salmon soup, with bunches of dill and a splash of lemon juice. I made this for Christmas day lunch, because it's light, and why not?<br/><br/> 10. <strong>Dopp i grytan</strong> – salty broth leftover from boiling the julskinka (Swedish Christmas ham). I love drinking it the day after Christmas. It tastes like culinary victory. <br/><br/><br/> Next for me: <br/><br/>Shchi (Russian cabbage soup), <br/>Zurek (Polish sour soup, or the Czech version with caraway added), <br/>honey carrot ginger soup, <br/>sauerkraut soup, <br/>Česnečka (Czech garlic soup), <br/>watercress soup, <br/>Bouillabaisse (Provençal fish stew), <br/>and of course, liver dumpling soup. </div> <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; padding: 10px;"> <strong>Oda al caldillo de congrio</strong><br/> (<em>Ode to conger eel stew</em>)<br/> Pablo Neruda<br/> <br/> En el mar <br/> tormentoso <br/> de Chile <br/> vive el rosado congrio, <br/> gigante anguila <br/> de nevada carne. <br/> Y en las ollas <br/> chilenas, <br/> en la costa, <br/> nació el caldillo <br/> grávido y suculento, <br/> provechoso. <br/> Lleven a la cocina <br/> el congrio desollado, <br/> su piel manchada cede <br/> como un guante <br/> y al descubierto queda <br/> entonces <br/> el racimo del mar, <br/> el congrio tierno <br/> reluce <br/> ya desnudo, <br/> preparado <br/> para nuestro apetito. <br/> Ahora <br/> recoges <br/> ajos, <br/> acaricia primero <br/> ese marfil <br/> precioso, <br/> huele <br/> su fragancia iracunda, <br/> entonces <br/> deja el ajo picado <br/> caer con la cebolla <br/> y el tomate <br/> hasta que la cebolla <br/> tenga color de oro. <br/> Mientras tanto <br/> se cuecen <br/> con el vapor <br/> los regios <br/> camarones marinos <br/> y cuando ya llegaron <br/> a su punto, <br/> cuando cuajó el sabor <br/> en una salsa <br/> formada por el jugo <br/> del océano <br/> y por el agua clara <br/> que desprendió la luz de la cebolla, <br/> entonces <br/> que entre el congrio <br/> y se sumerja en gloria, <br/> que en la olla <br/> se aceite, <br/> se contraiga y se impregne. <br/> Ya sólo es necesario <br/> dejar en el manjar <br/> caer la crema <br/> como una rosa espesa, <br/> y al fuego <br/> lentamente <br/> entregar el tesoro <br/> hasta que en el caldillo <br/> se calienten <br/> las esencias de Chile, <br/> y a la mesa <br/> lleguen recién casados <br/> los sabores <br/> del mar y de la tierra <br/> para que en ese plato <br/> tú conozcas el cielo.<br/> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="lists"/><category term="cooking"/><category term="poetry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soup-making is alchemy.

Next, consider academics who inform others in order to conform with them. While both firming and forming are intellectuals’ business, I’ve come down on the side of forming. A good poet innovates in form, while helping us conform to higher ideals. In other words, my ideal of language use privileges creative acts of (con)formation over replicative acts of confirmation.</p> <p>This identifies me with a kind of poetics shared by A. N. Whitehead and Richard Rorty. On one hand, I’m exasperated by fleeting arguments about metaphysics (Rorty), but on the other, metaphysical talk about enduring creations (Whitehead), such as rights, is self-evidently useful. Rorty’s critique[1] is still apt: The assertion that “there are rights,” could be redescribed as “under certain conditions we are disposed to say ‘there are rights,’ and that means…” The residue of Whitehead’s intuition after Rorty’s critique is an idea that it is in the business of times to change. So, we should make ourselves busy by changing things.</p> <p>David L. Hall helpfully clarified that Rorty and Whitehead began with different problematics.[2] Rorty wanted to solve an epistemological problem that results from having access to competing descriptive vocabularies. Hall wrote that “Whitehead’s problematic was how to characterize an intuition that, for a variety of reasons, had been marginalized in traditional philosophical discussion – namely, the intuition of flux and change.”[3]</p> <ul> That "all things flow" is the first vague generalization which the unsystematized, barely analyzed, intuition of men has produced... If we are able to go back to that ultimate, integral experience, unwarped by the sophistications of theory, that experience whose elucidation is the sole aim of philosophy, the flux of things is the one ultimate generalization around which we must weave our philosophic theory.<br/><br/>Alfred North Whitehead, <em>Process and Reality – an Essay in Cosmology</em> (The Free Press: 1978), 208. </ul> <p>The poet (<em>dichter</em>) and the philosopher (<em>denker</em>) do similar things. Rorty, for his “laissez-faire nominalism – his attempt to leave everything (except language) as it is – [was] forced to remain at the ‘meta’ level.”[4] He made everything of the poet and philosopher’s shared ability to change vocabularies and exchange metaphors. Whitehead was similarly disposed, but stricter in definition:</p> <ul> Philosophy is either self-evident or it is not philosophy... The aim of philosophy is sheer disclosure... (49)<br/> ... to find a conventional phraseology for the vivid suggestiveness of the poet... and thereby to produce a verbal symbolism manageable in other connections of thought (50).<br/><br/> Philosophy is akin to poetry... In each case there is reference to form beyond the direct meanings of words. Poetry allies itself to metre, philosophy to mathematical pattern. (174)<br/><br/> A. N. Whitehead, <em>Modes of Thought</em> (Macmillan 1938). </ul> <p>The difference between poetry and philosophy here is a matter of understanding, according to Hall’s interpretation of Whitehead. Poetry aids aesthetic understanding of the unrepeatable rhythms at a given time or place, while philosophy aids logical understanding of repeating, relational patterns. The distinction functions well enough.</p> <p>Rorty said that he attempted to “free Whitehead’s Category of the Ultimate (i.e., ‘Creativity’), not just from the theory of eternal objects, but from the fetters of a correspondence theory of truth, and from the idea that we need a super-science called metaphysics.”[5] His critics called him an anti-intellectual, regardless of their political leanings, because he reduced their shibboleths to favored words. This was due to his progressive, democratic philosophy. Poetry of the people, by the people, for the people – even if coincidence would determine what was actually read – would result in “a society that recognizes it is what it is… because certain poets and revolutionaries of the past spoke as they did.”[6] Human history is therefore “a long swelling, increasingly polyphonic poem that leads up to nothing save itself.”[7]</p> <p>I see here a similarity to Latour’s (1996) attempt to disabuse us of belief, to get us to stop believing in believing instead of doing. Rorty wrote: “If there really is an eternal fellow-sufferer who understands… so much the better, (but)… we can carry on perfectly well even if we suspect there is not.”[8] Hall wrote: “Socrates first advertised for our tradition that virtue is its own reward… But what if, as in the case of Socrates, one who believes that virtue is its own reward also has intimations of immortality? There’s the problem.”[9] We end up back near where I started – Rights are an example of the persistence of achieved value, and our metaphysical pretensions about rights are useful. Believing in rights does not maintain them, though. Action does. And verbal action, or poetry, does as well.</p> <p>Dewey gets the final word:</p> <ul> Peace in action not after it is the contribution of the ideal to conduct.<br/><br/> John Dewey, <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> (Random House: 1957), 264. </ul> <p><br/><br/> [1] Richard Rorty, “The Subjectivist Principle and the Linguistic Turn,” in <em>Alfred North Whitehead – Essays on His Philosophy</em>, ed.

But in English I so often hear trite phrases like “safe space” and “sacred space,” and I know that cartesian space is a post-enlightenment invention. As another example, we have Saxon “instead of” and Norman “in lieu of,” both meaning in place of. So, while I think that de Certeau clearly made the correct distinction for European languages, it is odd to note how Eastern scholars like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai">Arjun Appadurai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi-Fu_Tuan">Yi-Fu Tuan</a> have flipped the space/place distinction, thereby making more of place than space.</p> <p>It could be arbitrary. Or, it could be cosmological. In the Germanic languages, we have obvious toponyms like Norwich, Hallstatt, Uppsala, Trondheim, etc. But the literal signification is nil. Only in “the old city” do we refer to hall and heim for directions. By contrast, when I lived in Jordan, I was told by an American expat to pay attention to landmarks, because the locals supposedly navigate by them in a way that we road-and-route trekkers do not. I found this to be true (although, maybe we were just lost and trying to understand a foreign place).</p> <p>Arjun Appadurai’s (1995) concept of the “production of locality” is about “transforming spaces into places” (<a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816627936/modernity-at-large/">1996, 183</a>). He explicitly credited de Certeau for making the distinction. I suppose a postcolonial geography inverts things.</p> <p>Yi-Fu Tuan, an influential “human geographer” (funny title imo), wrote a <a href="https://archive.org/details/spaceplaceperspe0000tuan/page/n7/mode/2up">1977 book</a> arguing that <a href="https://ls.wisc.edu/news/belonging-to-this-place-a-conversation-with-yi-fu-tuan/">place is space made meaningful</a>. While both Tuan and de Certeau’s books were published by UMinn Press, and while the latter doesn’t reference the former, because of the distinct English vs. French milieus I don’t think we have here a case of appropriation. Instead, what I see is Tuan the geographer taking space for granted, and de Certeau the Derridean deconstructionist doing the opposite.</p> <p>The Greek and Latin etymologies aren’t too helpful. Plateia (<em>πλατεία</em>) -&gt; piazza, plaza, platz, etc. <em>Spatium</em> -&gt; espacio, l’espace, and space. Space has been uniquely used to refer to timespans in English. But in Arabic, I don’t think the distinction is salient – مكان (makaan) refers to both space and place, and it comes from the root for being and entities. The related word كون refers to the universe, all of God’s creation, the geography of which might be less human and more divine than I’m used to. Overall, I’m left thinking that we all have peculiar ideas of locality.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reflections"/><category term="language"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The space/place dichotomy is inverted by looking at it from East or West.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What comes after irony?</title><link href="https://jballhalla.github.io/blog/2025/What-comes-after-irony/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What comes after irony?"/><published>2025-01-18T23:33:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-18T23:33:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jballhalla.github.io/blog/2025/What%20comes%20after%20irony</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jballhalla.github.io/blog/2025/What-comes-after-irony/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/">Richard Rorty</a> was the most admirably plain-speaking of American philosophers. Since reading <em>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</em> (1987) as an undergraduate, I’ve thought of myself as a Rortian like Rorty thought of himself as a Deweyan. In short, Rorty’s ironist is someone who “has radical and continuing doubts about their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary#Final_vocabulary" title="Vocabulary">final vocabulary</a>” and “does not think their vocabulary is closer to reality than others.” Personally, it made sense for me to give up questions I viewed as unproductive – especially after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls#Philosophical_thought">John Rawls</a>, whose premises begin where I don’t want to end up (i.e., as an unencumbered self, devoid of peculiar values). Rorty the ironist gave me a philosophical vocabulary for responding with a “yes, I see your point, but anyway, I am what I am and like what people like me do, and so it seems for those other people too.”</p> <p>It took me years at Stanford to realize myself and how fortunate I am to begin my career where Rorty ended his. So, over the past couple weeks, I ducked into the archive to go through his papers. What I read deepened my appreciation for the man, who, with an iconoclastic gait, walked his own path and inspired me to walk mine.</p> <p>We have our differences. Rorty struggled to <a href="https://cdclv.unlv.edu/pragmatism/rorty_orchids.html">“hold reality and justice in a single vision,”</a> in my view because he never developed a good alternative to liberal elites’ dissociation. He acknowledged that “lucky Christians for whom the love of God and of other human beings are inseparable, or revolutionaries” might not feel the reality/justice split. But Rorty’s milieu was at once too continental and too pragmatic for him to be unironically hopeful.</p> <p>That never stopped him from speaking as though we could achieve our imagined possibilities. Rorty became a popular philosopher by saying that Americans, like philosophers, often ask the wrong questions. That made space for hope, for people to ask their own rather than respond to suppositions. As for himself, Rorty wrote in a memo re: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner">Richard Posner’s</a> pragmatism:</p> <ul> Disassociating the higher, in the sense of what breaks with the way things merely happen to be, from the blindingly clear and from the universal – from the models of mathematics –<br/>What is there that might serve as a source of moral obligation? That is the only question that philosophers discuss that intrigues non-philosophers. </ul> <p>Rorty saw the dualisms in Western thought as attempts to answer the obligatory question: pure/impure, subject/object, sacred/profane, etc. He wrote that “The source of moral obligation must itself be perfectly pure.” It’s odd, but I think explainable, that Posner the legalist spurred this realization. Rorty concluded that “the imagination” or “poetry” is that pure source of obligation.</p> <p>Lastly, I quote from a two page memo Rorty wrote for himself on Laclau and Moffe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony_and_Socialist_Strategy"><em>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</em></a> (1985). Judging by the folds and tatters on those two pages, Rorty brought the memo with him from the University of Virginia to Stanford. In it, he wrote:</p> <ul> The difference between us here is probably not worth arguing, because the difference between saying "we want everybody to have the same opportunities" and saying "we believe everybody has, by virtue of being human, the right to equal opportunities" is too thin to matter. I tend to regard the latter formulation as suspiciously metaphysical, but this may just be a symptom of over-sensitivity. <br/><br/> Laclau agrees with me that once the Philosophical is succeeded by the Political we will get narratives instead of philosophical systems, even of the relatively weak Habermasian "transcendental pragmatic" sort. Given this agreement, the only question that remains is whether "ironist" is the right word for somebody willing to affirm the groundlessness of the beliefs she dies for. Perhaps not. I may be trying to make this word do too much work; it seems to me right for Derrida in Paris, or even in jail in Prague, but I agree that it's probably not right for somebody at Auschwitz. </ul> <p>Is there any plain and honest word for an ironic urge to make something meaningful, or to make up something sacred? Eliade’s “hierophany” is honest but not plain. What about Milan Kundera’s “kitsch”? As ever, I come back to Japanese <em>aware</em> and aesthetics.

Her daughter starved; she went into exile. Amid the suffering, she wrote poems, she had affairs, and she corresponded with the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke">Rilke</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Pasternak">Pasternak</a>. Tsvetaeva rejected the revolution. She came from wealth, with an artistic pedigree, and was between foreign academies and Black Sea resorts before facing common life.

If you need an apéritif, take Tarkovsky’s own words: “I am often asked what does this Zone stand for. There is only one possible answer: the Zone doesn’t exist. Stalker himself invented the Zone. He created it, so that he would be able to bring there some very unhappy persons and impose on them the idea of hope.”)</em> <br/><br/><br/></p> <p>The Zone is nothing other than nature – ours and in itself. That’s my take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)"><em>Stalker</em>, a wonderfully abstract 1979 film</a> that enables multiple interpretations. Each scene is madly precise, and <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4739-stalker-meaning-and-making">filmmaking lore</a> makes Andrei Tarkovsky’s achievement seem even greater (and more ruthless). The titular stalker is a man who can lead others to the brink of self-reflection but does not allow himself. In his stubborn refusal, together with the writer and professor, to enter the Room – the domain of deepest desire – we see the religiosity Tarkovsky wanted to convey. But if not for the unseen hand of soviet correction,[^1] Tarkovsky might have dwelled too much on <em>The Idiot</em> and <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and made something else entirely. That would have been a shame, because what we have instead is as impersonal an artistic depiction of humanity as I have ever seen.[^2]</p> <p>I usually dislike pat takes, but Geoff Dyer’s description of <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?feature=shared&amp;t=38">the opening credits scene</a> is pat in the word’s positive sense (while I prefer <a href="https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/stalker/">Nick Schager’s take</a> overall):</p> <ul> An empty bar, possibly not even open, with a single table, no bigger than a small round table, but higher, the sort you then lean against – there are no stools – while you stand and drink. If floorboards could speak these look like they could tell a tale or two, though the tales would turn out to be one and the same, ending with the same old lament (after a few drinks people think they can walk all over me) not just in terms of what happens here, but in bars the world over. We are, in other words, already in a realm of universal truth.<br/>(Zona: A Book About a Film About a Journey to a Room, 2012) </ul> <p>Trying to make sense of <em>Stalker</em> is like trying to compose a subjective, universal theory of human nature. The actors – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kaidanovsky">Kaidanovsky</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Solonitsyn">Solonitsyn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Grinko">Grinko</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisa_Freindlich">Freindlich</a> – projected their own, as did the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_and_Boris_Strugatsky">brothers Strugatsky</a>, who wrote the source material, and of course, so did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a>. Some theories are truthier than others, however, and the interpretation I propose is inescapable.</p> <p>One view is that the Zone represents the stalker’s self-aware illusions, as Tarkovsky said. Another view, the one I hold, is that the Zone is nature incarnate. The two views are inseparable. A distinction could be drawn between one man’s nature and human nature, but it would just as soon disappear. Similarly, we could live in a natural world devoid of anything holy, but we would not live for long.</p> <p>Why, except for the opportunity to stage a <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?feature=shared&amp;t=1833">daring escape from the USSR</a>, would the screenwriters and director depict the trio of stalker, writer, and professor being shot at while entering the Zone? Allegorical quashing of the personal is a would-be dissident’s thing, surely. In that case, monitoring and informing on one another are what kill. But the Zone is devoid of intelligence operatives. And while the writer and professor betray their promises to the stalker, to respect him, they do not betray him to the guards. The barbed wire around the Zone is just another barricade erected to prevent natural reactions to suffering, and it might as well be in America.</p> <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?feature=shared&amp;t=5156">film’s most allegorical scene</a> flows up a shallow river, amid which the stalker sleeps on an ait, before coming to his outstretched, Michelangelesque hand. This particular scene was shot in sepia tones – the visual code used in the film to signify that the stalker is back in modern existence, although he is simultaneously dreaming inside the Zone. Trawling up the river, we see all kinds of creations: a submerged Orthodox icon, for example, as well as machines and syringes. But the image that caught my eye was a bowl submerged inside the river with fish inside it, shown as soon as the monologue fades. Is the fishbowl a sanctuary or a prison? To my mind, that is the crux.</p> <p>Tarkovsky had this to say in <em>Sculpting in Time</em> (1987):</p> <ul> This, too, is what Stalker is about: the hero goes through moments of despair when his faith is shaken; but every time he comes to a renewed sense of his vocation to serve people who have lost their hopes and illusions. </ul> <p>The way he moves in the Zone clarifies things: the stalker leads from behind. The others try going their separate paths, but they reunite. No movement is unilinear, and only natural man[^3] can determine where they are going – by sortilege, it seems to the intelligentsia. Finally, the three of them just <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?feature=shared&amp;t=8395">sit together</a> at the Room’s entrance, the professor fiddling with a gadget and testing the water by throwing stones, the writer beside the hero pensively gazing at their reflection, and the stalker perhaps content for their company. He rues the intellectuals’ nihilism in the end, but still, they came to him for inspiration (and as his voluminous book collection later shows, he to them).</p> <p>But wait, you might ask, how could the Zone be about nature (ours and Earth’s) when <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?feature=shared&amp;t=2738">it was said to have been created by a meteorite, or not a meteorite exactly</a>? Speculation on the matter has featured atomic bombs and Chernobyl disasters, in addition to the alien visitation described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic">the Strugatskys’ novel</a>. In any event, we often give life to that which takes it away. We also forbid some objects, because we know it is in our nature to abuse them. Sometimes the forbidding itself is an arbitrary abuse of power. The more prudent questions, in my opinion, are <em>how</em> could authorities forbid certain expressions of our nature, and <em>when</em> should we accept them?</p> <p>Let Tarkovsky’s words from <em>Sculpting in Time</em> conclude things:</p> <ul> People have often asked me what The Zone is, and what it symbolizes… The Zone doesn’t symbolise anything, any more than anything else does in my films: the zone is a zone, it’s life. </ul> <p>In exile, facing his own mortality, he wrote:</p> <ul> In the end, everything can be reduced to the one simple element which is all a person can count upon in his existence: the capacity to love. </ul> <p>That too is only natural. <br/><br/> <br/> [1] Do not discount fate, either: A literal earthquake prevented filming in Tajikistan and necessitated a move to Estonia, while a corrupted film reel supposedly forced the director to re-film the present version from scratch.</p> <p>[2] In case you do not find the film sufficiently impersonal, read into the lore: Tarkovsky may have killed himself, his wife Larisa, and the writer (actor Anatoly Solonitsyn) by filming three separate takes, all the while surrounded by chemicals from hydroelectric and manufacturing plants near Tallinn. They each died in middle age of lung cancer.</p> <p>[3] Forgive me for pointing out that the writer says he imagined the stalker like “Leather Stocking, or Chingachgook, or Big Snake” – referring to James Fenimore Cooper’s Mohican character inventions. Dante’s Virgil is nowhere in sight.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reviews"/><category term="cinema"/><category term="nature"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why not face our nature?

It’s taboo to go through before graduating, but I often did anyway because it was a pain to go around without walking over icy grass or perpendicular sidewalks. Maybe that’s why I barely remember passing through it during Commencement, in line with tradition. Oops.

Eyvind (eye-vind) Earle led a full career but is best known for illustrating the expressionistic backgrounds in Disney’s <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (1959). Earle was the central coast’s best appreciator (apart from Robinson Jeffers[^1]), and a fellow NY transplant who repeatedly painted views of the Santa Lucia range rolling down to meet the Pacific. The gallery owner told me that Earle worked like a mystic, hanging all his WIPs around the studio and working on them simultaneously, one touch at a time. ADHD, I first thought, but cohesiveness I now recognize. A poem was displayed in the gallery’s front window:</p> <ul> Starting from nothing <br/> to where we are,<br/> is farther than the farthest star.<br/><br/> And farther than the farthest star,<br/> is where we are going from where we are.<br/><br/> – Eyvind Earle, 1979 </ul> <p>Youthful hubris gives way to aged wisdom, and the world keeps turning.

This is the thrust of Bruno Latour’s 1996 essay, translated as “On the Cult of the Factish Gods” (2010).[^1] Latour’s moral was that we should stop believing in belief, because truth and facts are always made up through action and dialogue, and if we sanctify what we make instead of the process of making, then we lose our power. A few years later (1998), Richard Rorty and Bjørn Ramberg, following Donald Davidson’s lead, concluded that accounts of truth are automatically accounts of agency. Rorty called this the “inescapability of the normative.”[^2] When similar ideas emerge at once in different places, a significant event has occurred. The next step, I think, is theorizing internormativity, or a multilingual meta-ethics.</p> <p>But for now, I am back at Latour’s essay, which is tricky and enlightening. I got lost in its thicket of wordplays and references, so I intend this post as a guide for returning to. Here is a summary of the main point about fetishes:</p> <ul> ... even among the Moderns, the fetish, far from being drained of its efficacy, always seems to act in such a way as to shift, muddle, invert, and perturb the origins of belief, as well as the very certainty that mastery is possible. The fetish immediately regains the power that people seek to deny it.[^3] </ul> <p>Latour’s opening figures[^4] depict what all this is generally about:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>These show the process of debunking and its obverse (rebunking?), although “power” is missing, which explains the asymmetry behind Latour’s symmetrical design. The subtext is moral – should we Moderns be doing this to others? But the essay does not really get at the human heart of the matter, the <em>why</em>.</p> <p>Here is a passage that approximates <em>why</em>:</p> <ul> Why insist so strongly on an absolute distinction [between fact-objects and fairy-objects] that can never be applied? Because it is used precisely to redouble the advantages of practice with those of theory. The double repertoire of the Moderns cannot be discovered in their distinction between facts and fetishes, but in the *second*, more subtle distinction between the separation of facts from fetishes that they institute in theory, on the one hand, and the totally different passage from one to the other that they carry out in their practice, on the other. Belief then takes on a new meaning: it is what allows one to keep the practical form of life, in which one causes something to be fabricated, at a distance from the theoretical forms of life, in which one has to choose between facts and fetishes. This is how critical thinkers can go on purifying theory indefinitely, without having to face the possible consequences of their purification.[^5] </ul> <p>Latour got religious with the last sentence – why <em>do</em> we set apart theory from practice, despite everything? A unifying theory of our nature would show how real vagaries necessitate the distinction, but it remains elusive.</p> <p>So, Latour invented a new term instead:</p> <ul> Joining the two etymological sources [of fact and fetish], we shall use the label *factish* for the robust certainty that allows practice to pass into action without the practitioner ever believing in the difference between construction and reality, immanence and transcendence.(^23: One should add to this the artifact, in the laboratory sense of a parasite mistaken for a new being. Unlike facts, artifacts are surprising, because human actions can be discovered where they have not been expected. The word thus provides a transition between the surprise of facts and the surprise of fetishes. There is no more reason for giving up the word "fetish" than for giving up the word "fact," on the pretext that the Moderns believed in belief and wanted to disqualify the former term while retaining the latter. In practice, no one has ever believed in fetishes, and everyone has paid astute attention to facts. The two words thus remain intact. Since the phonemic difference between the French terms *fée* and *fait* ("fairy" and "fact") is not always audible, some might prefer *factiche* over *faitiche* in French. In the English "factish," the etymological link to "fairy" is unfortunately lost.) </ul> <p>I am uneasy with the claim that no one has ever believed in fetishes, although this is not to argue that no ever <em>practiced</em> a belief in fetishes. Following Mircea Eliade’s hierophany and Alexei Lidov’s hierotopy, and also de Certeau’s axiom that “space is practiced place,” it does seem that wherever fetishes feel most real, we find people practicing habits about them and thereby acting in line with (social?) facts. But this is relativistic in the extreme. My experiences as a guest among various communities have aligned with the idea that, regardless of place (but conditional on other things), we share a basic kind of moral reciprocity, or fundamental norms, or even the fear of god(‘s’) watchful eye. This could be called a fact of life, but our sacral behavior toward it puzzles me. Latour came around somewhere near this point, noting how we “continue doing what we have always done,” albeit with a practical justification and/or in secret:</p> <ul> The very notion of practice arises from the requirement that the Moderns impose. Since we cannot express ourselves in the either-or terms of critical thinking, we are obliged to continue doing what we have always done, but in secret.(^28: Amusingly enough, the pragmatism that could be taken for the philosophy of practice remains so intimidated by the authoritative position of its adversaries that it is forced to depict practice as modest, limited, utilitarian, humanist, and convenient, thereby occupying – unquestioningly – the place critical philosophy had prepared for it. Modesty is a philosophical virtue only if it decides for itself how it will keep from telling somebody what to do or from proposing foundations.) Practice is the clandestine wisdom of the passage that stubbornly maintains (but since it can no longer say so out loud, it is content merely to act accordingly, to murmur its message in hushed tones) that construction and reality are synonyms.[^6] </ul> <p>It will take time to sink in. Meanwhile, Latour prudently digressed on <em>Bhharathipura</em>, a 1973 novel by the Kannada-language writer U.R. Ananthamurthy. It tells the story of a Brahmin, Jagannantha, who blasphemes his ancestral religion by taking his family’s <em>shaligram</em>, a holy black stone (lit. an ammonite), from its sacred spot and trying to force members of a pariah caste to touch it. They do not. Jagannantha only succeeds in besmirching his own nest:</p> <ul> The priest, the aunt, and the pariahs already know what Jagannath discovers by his failure: it has nothing to do with belief, it is all about behavior. It is not about a fetish-stone, but about factishes, about those off-center beings that allow us to live, that is, to pass continually from construction to autonomy without ever believing in either. Thanks to factishes, construction and truth remain synonymous. Once broken, they become antonyms. We can no longer pass. We can no longer create. We can no longer live. Then we have to set up factishes all over again.[^7] </ul> <p>Here, the wellspring of facts and fairies ran dry, so Latour code-switched into the “language of philosophers” and plumbed it again:</p> <ul> "[The] stubborn refusal to choose [between immanence and transcendence]... always shows up, we now understand, as a simple practice, as something that can never be spoken or theorized, even if the 'actors-themselves' keep on saying it and describing it in luxurious detail.(^32: ... [T]his amounts to generalizing an ethnomethodological approach by extending it into metaphysics by way of semiotics, the only *organon* we have at our disposal that can fearlessly maintain the diversity of modes of existence – at the price, to be sure, of putting them into language and text, a restriction that we have nonetheless sought to overcome by extending the overly-restrictive definition of semiotics to things themselves. And so once again we come across the entities that had interested us from the start – under the vague heading of "actor-network" – and that are at once real, social, and discursive.)[^8] </ul> <p><em>Voilà</em>. But since we grasp things better when they have concise names like “actor-network theory,” I prefer Rorty’s parsimonious phrasing: Any account of truth is automatically an account of agency. This leaves open the question of how to make up an actual research method that models people and their dialogic processes of truth making, their crafts for fabricating fetishes, their science in action, etc.</p> <p>Latour preferred ethnography, and his footnotes also say: go read Tobie Nathan and Isabelle Stengers. He could not resist another coinage, however, and in his pamphlet’s last trick, he made up the word “transfears” after observing a patient’s diagnosis at a psychiatric clinic. Evidently tiring of factishes, Latour instead began using “divinities” to describe how an objective temperament – a mental syndrome, or perhaps, an orisha – comes to be seated on one’s head. Religious initiation and psychiatric diagnosis require the conferral / transferal of a supposedly new status, hence why he reached for a new word:</p> <ul> Let us venture one more term to define these divinities at last. I propose to call them "fears," borrowing Tobie Nathan's lovely explanation for this word, which has the advantage of presuming neither essence nor person.(^62: Nathan, *L'influence qui guérit*. Nathan contrasts "anguish" and "fright." Anguish is supposed to have no outside cause and comes entirely from the subject's own projection; fright, on the contrary is clearly the realization that there is something outside that has caused you to be frightened.)[^9] </ul> <p>Much earlier, around 1665, François de La Rochefoucauld expressed fear’s incitement of action in <em>Maximes</em>, no. 38:</p> <ul> Nous promettons selon nos espérances, et nous tenons nos craintes. / Promises are made according to our hopes, and kept according to our fears.[^10] </ul> <p><strong>Perhaps ethnographies of fear phenomena can describe both facts and fetishes, or why we make and worship them, better than philosophies – something I will continue to ponder.</strong> But for now, I am quite finished with Latour’s essay and will leave further discussion of his iconoclasm for another time.</p> <p>Finally, here are some closing quotes and figures to bookend the discussion:</p> <ul> No one, in practice, has ever displayed naive belief in any being whatsoever.(^43: From one year to the next, each of the canonical examples finds itself overturned by modern historiography, as in the admirable case studied by Jeffrey Burton Russell in *Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians* (1991). How those monks have been mocked for being naive enough to believe in a flat earth in the literal sense. The author proves, with brio, that this particular belief in naive belief dates back to the nineteenth century, when there was actually nothing naive about it, since it shared in the beautiful Enlightenment scenography that was emerging from the dark ages.) If there is such a thing as belief at all, it is the most complex, sophisticated, critical, subtle, reflective activity there is.(^44: Catherine Darbo-Peschanski's *Le discours du particulier: Essai sur l'enquête hérodotéene* (1987). This has been a decisive work for me: it can serve as an overall method for bringing together the diversity of positions that has been crushed by the notion of belief. For more recent examples, see Émilie Gomart, "Methodone: Six Effects in Search of a Substance," *Social Studies of Science 32, no.1 (2002): 93-135.) But this subtlety can never unfold if one first attempts to break it down into cause-objects, source-subjects, and representations. To take away the ontology of belief, on the pretext that it occurs inside the subject, is to misunderstand objects and human actors alike. It is to miss the wisdom of the factishes.[^11] </ul> <p>Denouement (all following correspond to a single footnote below)[^12]:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig8-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig8-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig8-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-10-fig8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Quote:</p> <ul> Instead of a causal chain transmitting a force that actualizes a potential, realizes a possibility, you will never obtain more than a series of slight surpassings.

Is an engineer master of his machine? Was Pasteur master of his lactic acid? Is a programmer master of his program, a creator, of his creation, an author, of his text? No one who has ever truly acted could utter such impieties. It is because God is a creature and because our creations possess, in relationship to ourselves, as much autonomy as we possess in relationship to God, that we can continue to use the words "construction" and "creation" without lying.(^83: Discoveries in theology are rare; but Whitehead's discovery of the creature god certainly counts as one. Indeed, for Whitehead it was less a matter of discovering than of understanding, through a different language, what everybody had already understood in a different way: Whitehead's god is *incarnate*. "All actual entities share with God this characteristic of self-causation. For this reason every actual entity also shares with God the characteristic of transcending all other actual entities, including God" (*Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosomology*. New York: Free Press, 1978, 222). To believe that God will now submerge himself among his creatures is to keep on repeating the same mistake. Creatures are not immanent. Mediations, events, passages, and *factishes* can be used neither for drowning, nor for dissolving, but only for producing. They come to pass. They differ.) </ul> <p>Finally:</p> <ul> In the common world of comparative anthropology, lights cross paths. Differences are not there to be respected, neglected, or subsumed, but, as Whitehead said, to act as "lures for feelings, food for thought." </ul> <p>As priests say, <em>amen</em>, and neurochemists say <em>amine</em>.</p> <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> <p>[1] Bruno Latour and Catherine Porter, <em>On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods</em> (Duke University Press, 2010).</p> <p>[2] Richard Rorty, 29 December 1998, “Response to Bjorn Ramberg,” Richard Rorty papers, M2558 Box 2, Folder 2, Special Collections and Archives, Green Library, Stanford University, 1.</p> <p>[3] Latour and Porter, “Factish Gods,” 11.</p> <p>[4] <em>Ibid.,</em> 12-15.</p> <p>[5] <em>Ibid.,</em> 20-21.</p> <p>[6] <em>Ibid.,</em> 24.</p> <p>[7] <em>Ibid.,</em> 28.</p> <p>[8] <em>Ibid.</em></p> <p>[9] <em>Ibid.,</em> 52.</p> <p>[10] The Duc de La Rochefoucauld, <em>Reflections, or Moral Opinions &amp; Maxims: a bilingual edition</em>, trans.

Thus, while we may claim to be secular and scientific in public, we have never been areligious. This continues Latour’s theme of symmetry, earlier developed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Have_Never_Been_Modern"><em>We Have Never Been Modern</em> (1993)</a>. I approve of the cleverness. Mating ideas to the historical peculiarities of the words we use to express them is something that Heidegger did splendidly in his lecture on <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/1/1d/Heidegger_Martin_1950_2000_Das_Ding.pdf"><em>Das Ding</em> (“The Thing”)</a>, and Latour carried the torch well.[^1] Tellingly, however, the uglier neologism “iconoclash” was instead ported to <a href="https://zkm.de/de/ausstellung/2002/05/iconoclash">Germany for a 2002 art installation</a>, the written accompaniment to which makes up chapter 2 of the book. Then chapter 3 is a closing sermon on scientism. Overall, I agree with the claim that our practices and taboos about science are weirdly religious. But the English fête prepared for Latour by Duke Press was unwarranted.</p> <p>The pamphlet adapted into chapter 1, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petite_r%C3%A9flexion_sur_le_culte_moderne_des_dieux_faitiches"><em>Petite réflexion sur le culte moderne des dieux faitiches</em> (1996)</a>, pretends to show a little more humility than the translated version. Reading the English is daunting, not only for its density, but for its pretentious style and numerous footnotes. That said, <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/116668/669026.pdf?sequence=1">as Rosalind Williams emphasized in her review</a>, the footnotes are illuminating. (Some generous soul also underlined the most interesting passages in the copy of the book I borrowed from Stanford’s library, so I take back what I wrote about the fête.)
